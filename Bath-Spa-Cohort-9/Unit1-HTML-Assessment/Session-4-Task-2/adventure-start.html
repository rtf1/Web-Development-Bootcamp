        <p>It's been almost fourteen days since the start of the zombie outbreak. Food, water, electricity and other utilities have been cut-off for sometime now and you are beginning to run out of the essentials.</p>
        <p>It is likely other survivors have also started to emerge from their hide-aways as they become desperate for the limited supplies probably still available. Widespread looting (and the occasional zombie!) is to be expected. </p>
        <p>What are you doing to do?</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="remain.html">Remain in place. It has been close to two-weeks and no zombies have found you here (yet!). It is safe here, but you are starting to get a little peckish and have just eaten your last packet of SuperNoodles.</a>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="outside.html">Head out. Although the safety of the shelter is appealing - you need to get some supplies to ensure that you donâ€™t starve to death. Some snacks would be nice - Haribo StarMix anyone?</a>
            </li>
